      <h3>Challenge</h3>
      <p> The goal of this lab was to write functions that take user input and
         manipulate a string while working with a partner. </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3>Problems</h3>
      <p> We had slight issues creating a file structure. At first, we incorrectly
          linked the css and js files to the html page because we had named them
          differently than in past labs.</p>
