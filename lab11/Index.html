    <div id="challenge" class="special">
      <h3>Challenge</h3>
      <p>
        The challenge of this lab was to experiment with jQuery while working with a partner. We were to
        make a series of buttons with different functions.
       </p>

    <div id="problems">
      <h3>Problems</h3>
      <p>
        During the lab I encountered an issue when linking my jQuery and css file. I accidentally
        put an unnecessary space in the code which caused the links to not work. 
      </p>
    </div>

    <div id="results">
      <h3>Results</h3>
      <p>
        Our team created a series of buttons that changed the font, color, and appearance of our sections.
